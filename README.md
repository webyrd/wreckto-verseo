Experiments with the Verse Calculus in miniKanren

The Verse Calculus is described in the paper [The Verse Calculus: a Core Calculus for Functional Logic Programming](https://simon.peytonjones.org/assets/pdfs/verse-conf.pdf)

Greg Rosenblatt has implemented small-step interpreters in Racket for [miniVerse (and microVerse)](https://github.com/gregr/experiments/tree/master/verse)
